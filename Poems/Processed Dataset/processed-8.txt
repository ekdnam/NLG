Once a dream did weave a shade \n, Oer my angel-guarded bed, \n, That an emmet lost its way \n, Where on grass methought I lay. \n,  \n, Troubled, wildered, and forlorn, \n, Dark, benighted, travel-worn, \n, Over many a tangled spray, \n, All heart-broke, I heard her say: \n,  \n, O my children! do they cry, \n, Do they hear their father sigh? \n, Now they look abroad to see, \n, Now return and weep for me. \n,  \n, Pitying, I dropped a tear: \n, But I saw a glow-worm near, \n, Who replied, What wailing wight \n, Calls the watchman of the night? \n,  \n, I am set to light the ground, \n, While the beetle goes his round: \n, Follow now the beetles hum; \n, Little wanderer, hie thee home!
