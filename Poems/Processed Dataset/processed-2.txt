Do not stand at my grave and weep \n, I am not there; I do not sleep. \n, I am a thousand winds that blow, \n, I am the diamond glints on snow, \n, I am the sun on ripened grain, \n, I am the gentle autumn rain. \n, When you awaken in the mornings hush \n, I am the swift uplifting rush \n, Of quiet birds in circled flight. \n, I am the soft stars that shine at night. \n, Do not stand at my grave and cry, \n, I am not there; I did not die. \n
