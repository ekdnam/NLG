Ah, sunflower, weary of time, \n, Who countest the steps of the sun; \n, Seeking after that sweet golden clime \n, Where the travellers journey is done; \n,  \n, Where the Youth pined away with desire, \n, And the pale virgin shrouded in snow, \n, Arise from their graves, and aspire \n, Where my Sunflower wishes to go!
